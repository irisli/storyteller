This is just the storyteller.js library. To see the repository for the Stellar slideshows and graphic novels, go to: [https://github.com/stellar/stories](https://github.com/stellar/stories). Development of both the stories content/app and storyteller.js are on that repo to improve development flow. This software is undergoing a lot of changes and will likely break between updates.

## Example
See [Stellar Stories](https://www.github.com/stellar/stories/) (https://www.github.com/stellar/stories/) for an example of an app that uses storyteller.js.
